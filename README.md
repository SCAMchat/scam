# SCAM - Simple Chat And Messaging Protocol

SCAM is a web protocol that was designed to be easy to understand and use.
It focuses on transporting messages to and from a server based chatroom that is accessible through a url.

SCAM messages are not encrypted by default, but encrypted messages are supported by the protocol.

## Specification (SCAM RfC)

There is a full specification document for SCAM. You can find and comment on it here:
